# Cthereum

Ethereum binaries implemented in C.

Code should be:

1. Fast
2. Discrete
3. Modular
4. Performant
5. Reliable

Libraries are custom-made and performant to the protocol's exact specifications. A multi-client ecosystem is unimportant if one client can optimize everythin better. Cthereum should be made to bind with the extant public Ethereum blockchains and protocols. Most importantly, it should be compatible with the major clients and the already formed consensus algorithms. 

Once that step is ascertained in C code, optimizations to public Ethereum should become increasingly easier to implement, while older difficulties fall away. The system should stabilize over time, becoming something like the Linux kernel: built in C, reliable, and good for dozens or hundreds  of other implementations and uses.

This project is just beginning, so much work remains to be done.
